mtube
=====

A simple Bash script for playing Youtube videos using mplayer.

Update: Having issues with mplayer and youtube-dl now using vlc by default. For now mplayer and youtube-dl are still required for the script to run without errors.


Required packages:
    
    youtube-dl
    
    mplayer

    vlc
    
    curl

Note:
    youtube-dl will periodically require updating for video playback to function. Be sure to read youtube-dl documentation for more details (man youtube-dl)
    Be aware that since original development of this script changes made to youtube-dl and/or mplayer could result in the script not working properly.
